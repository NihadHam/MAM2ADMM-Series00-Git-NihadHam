This repository is used to learn the basics of Git and GitHub.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to learning the fundamentals of Git and GitHub through practical application. 
While my current experience is limited, Iâ€™m looking forward to learning more about Git and GitHub as I build experience with commits, branches, pull requests, and collaboration. 
My goal is to deepen my understanding and apply these version control practices effectively in future projects.
