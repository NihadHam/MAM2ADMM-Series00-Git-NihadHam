This repository is used to learn the basics of Git and GitHub.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to learning the fundamentals of Git and GitHub through practical application. 
While my current experience is limited, I’m looking forward to learning more about Git and GitHub as I build experience with commits, branches, pull requests, and collaboration. 
My goal is to deepen my understanding and apply these version control practices effectively in future projects.

## Summary :

## What I Learned

This assignment helped me get hands-on experience with Git and GitHub, turning theory into practice.  
I explored creating branches, making commits, pushing changes, and managing files.  
I also practiced adding images, both from the web and my local computer, and formatting content in Markdown. Using commands like "git branch","git add", "git commit", and "git push" became much more natural through real use.  
Overall, I spent about 2 hours on this work, and I feel more confident navigating version control and documenting projects.
